# fire-tools-go
This project is being worked on at a slower pace so I can get to learn GO and create a good experience for users. In the future this will merge into Fire-Tools, until then development and betas will be here.

## Planned Features/Milestones:
- [ ] Proper system specific executables
- [ ] GUI
- [ ] Parsing of JSON formatted debloat list with package, friendly_name, and description variables
- [ ] Debloat button with selectable options (set dns, set animation speed, disable background apps, etc)
- [ ] Backups? (export global/secure settings and package list)
- [ ] Device identifier for Fire TV/Stick support
- [ ] New device tags: `Generic`, `Fire Device Name`, and `Not Detected`
- [ ] ADB Shell tab
- [ ] Rebrand/rename tool?
